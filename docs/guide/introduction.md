VueNiceValidate is a validation library for Vue.js. It uses Directive+Data based approch to validate your form or fields.
With great DX and steep learning curve this package aims to improve code quality and productivity of developers.
All validation rules are defined inside template without any extra component, you can check or run validation in one line.
It doesn't add much boiler plate to your vue code unlike other validation frameworks,
